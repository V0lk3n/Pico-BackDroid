# Pico-BackDroid

Pico-BackDroid is a python script that install an APK payload on an android device with HID injection. Build onCircuitPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

I created this project for fun, and up my knowledges. After getting fun with Pico-Ducky, I decided to make a project myself against Android.

# Versions

Actually there are two version.

- The first one is the basic one, where you need to specify which device you target inside the code before runing it.
- The second code is the GPO Pins version, here you need jumper, and connect specified pins to letting know the pico which device you want to target. The goal is to add a selector at the "end" of the project.
